### 🛒 Smart Trolley using Arduino and RFID

**Description:**
The **Smart Trolley System** is an IoT-based project designed to make shopping faster, smarter, and more efficient. Using **Arduino**, **RFID technology**, and an **I2C LCD display**, this project automates the billing process inside supermarkets. Each product has an RFID tag, and when the customer places an item in the trolley, the RFID reader scans it and displays the item name and price on the LCD screen in real time.

Once shopping is complete, the total bill is automatically calculated and can be sent to the billing counter or displayed for digital payment.

### 💡 Working Principle

1. Each product is attached with a unique RFID tag.
2. When the product is placed near the RFID reader, it reads the tag’s ID.
3. The Arduino processes this data, matches it with the product information (name & price), and displays it on the I2C LCD.
4. The total amount updates automatically as new items are added or removed.
5. At checkout, the final bill can be displayed or sent to a central system for payment.
